## About this repo
The content here was based on what I learned on the Udemy course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp][python-course] taught by Dr. Angela Yu. I want to share how this journey looked for me.

I hope it could be a guide to anyone and please feel free to comment anything. :D
