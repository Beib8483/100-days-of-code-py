## About this challenge
Goal: Build a console application script to play a simple version of blackjack

The simple version of blackjack consists in the use of a deck with the following values:

`[11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]`

Cards won't be dropped out from the list, meaning that there is the same probability of pulling one out from the deck, evry time a card is requested
